================================

A Visual Studio C# .NET windows form sample for the Intel Perceptual Computing SDK 2013. 


---The project in a nutshell---

Basically this is a program that uses Intel Perceptual SDK to perform face location/detection (including confidence), landmark detection (location of eyes, mouth, nose) and face attributes detection(age, emotion, eye status, gender) in a windows form.

---Three easy steps to get the sample running on Visual Studio C# .NET---

2.-Clone the repository on your desktop (click the "Clone in Desktop" button and follow the steps), and open de .sln file.
